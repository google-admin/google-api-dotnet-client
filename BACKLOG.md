# Requested enhancements and bug backlog

This file is used to keep track of feature requests that we *may*
want to come back to at some point, but aren't on our immediate
radar. Using this single document is simpler than keeping all the
corresponding issues open, but we'll reopen the issue if we revisit
the request and want to put work into it.
